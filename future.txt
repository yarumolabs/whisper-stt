Works great but the problem is that I have to keep the extension menu open and click stop, and if I close the extension the converted audio to text disapears or resets, I'd like it to listen continously and keep generating text in the page so the flow would be: 
1. I click the extension, it starts listening I can freely browse the website where I'm working
2. When I click the extension again it simply stops listening. 
Please provide very detailed instructions about existing files, and where to make the adjustments. Also provide the full code for whatever file needs to be updated
